# Arduino-Web-Bin
This project demonstrates a Smart Waste Segregator system built using Python, Flask, and Flask-SocketIO. The system reads data from a serial port connected to sensors measuring waste levels and sends this data to a web interface in real-time. The web interface dynamically updates based on the waste levels.
